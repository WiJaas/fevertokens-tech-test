 In the scenario where my friend and I are stranded on an infinite bidirectional highway with no means of communication, the approach to locate my friend's car needs to be both strategic and methodical. I will keep driving in both directions randomly while actively searching for my friend's car. Since I have an unlimited supply of gas, I'll begin by driving in any direction and then set a predetermined time limit for my journey in that direction, starting with 30 minutes, as shown in the illustration.
After the initial 30 minutes, I'll turn my car around and drive in the opposite direction for an additional 30 minutes. I'll repeat this pattern, incrementing the time by 30 minutes with each cycle, until I find my friend.
